# Write-A-Data-Science-Blog

In this project, I worked on the first Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree project.

# Installation

In order to run this project you need to install Python 3. Also some analyizing and visualizing libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn are needed to be installed. The data I used in my analysis was provided by Airbnb for which link is given below.

# Project Motivation

I was interested in analysing Seattle Airbnb data which was provided by Udacity in the course. In the original data there was 3818 rows and 92 columns. In this project I looked for answers to three questions below. With my analysis I tried to hep landlords with pricing and featuring for their properties.

1. What is the landlords' preferences for lenght of stay?
2. What are the most common amenities?
3. What factors do affect price of proprty most?
